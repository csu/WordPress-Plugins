== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What colors may be used with the color tag? =

Any that would normally fit in `<font color="">`. That includes the names of common colors and hex representations of colors.

= Do I need to use quotes with the url and color tags? =

No. Standard BBCode does not need quotation marks around URLs or colors in those tags.
